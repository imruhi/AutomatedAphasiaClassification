*INV:	how do you think your speech is these days . 135145_136805
*PAR:	it [/] it kind of depends on the day &-uh as much as anything in the time of day . 139565_145185
*PAR:	the &-uh it seems like my speech is more &-uh harder to distinguish . 145965_154945
*PAR:	<first thing in the mornings> [//] &-uh <in the> [/] &-uh in the afternoons it seems like it's easier &-uh than it is first thing in the morning . 154945_164975
*PAR:	first thing in the morning . 165015_165735
*PAR:	it seems like I have . 165735_166775
*PAR:	and it's just I think because &-um &-um I don't know my [/] my brain just is not catching up fast enough to &-um blaze forward . 167395_180215
*PAR:	but &-um I keep trying to think little things . 180395_185848
*PAR:	&-like [//] &-um one of the things that I try to do in [/] <in my> [//] with language is <I am> [//] I worked for years as a quality control officer . 185848_196813
*PAR:	and . 196715_196935
*INV:	mhm . 196955_197375
*PAR:	and doing that you have <an immense> [//] a [//] an [//] amassed a [//] volumes of &-uh special safety sheets that you read for these type of meetings where you'll they'll pull out a sheet . 197835_211435
*PAR:	you'll real [//] read it . 211435_212515
*PAR:	and [/] and &-uh and so I've got [//] amassed hundreds and hundreds of those things . 212535_216395
*PAR:	and &-uh so I've got all these on the computer . 217315_220295
*PAR:	and <I would just> [//] so that's what I started doing was reading them out loud . 220555_224175
*PAR:	&-uh I started that just recently because <didn't feel like I was> [//] &-uh I got thinking about it . 225255_232995
*PAR:	it's &-like you know <I can> [/] I can read on a computer just fine . 232995_235475
*PAR:	the trouble is <it doesn't> [//] I cannot . 235535_238125
*PAR:	&*INV:mhm pronounce them . 238665_239865
*PAR:	and &-uh the words are not as smooth as I would like . 240225_244005
*PAR:	and so that's when I started looking at the dynamic of being able to just read off a computer and just [//] or read it . 244465_251805
*PAR:	open a book . 251805_252285
*PAR:	and one of the things that I have found . 253305_255685
*PAR:	and <it's just> [//] probably just . 256185_258700
*PAR:	and I don't remember <when I> [/] <when I> [//] it used to do . 259185_261805
*PAR:	I mean even fifteen years ago I was never a great reader . 261925_266255
*PAR:	especially if I had to read in a big crap for some reason . 266705_270705
*PAR:	<it's just> [//] it's in my psyche . 270775_272465
*PAR:	I'm sorry . [+ exc] 272485_272825
*PAR:	but I have [//] &-uh but and <I told you> [/] I told you about the [/] the two men . 273565_278745

*INV:	yes . 286435_286655
*PAR:	okay . 287125_287415
*PAR:	that's the type of dynamic that we worked with in construction because not +... 287715_291215
*PAR:	and I happened to be one of the lucky ones who had a background of a college education . 291315_296375
*PAR:	I went to parochial schools . 296575_298455
*PAR:	and so I had a &-uh better than average chance for people to get ahead . 299315_305215
*INV:	mhm . 305795_306215
*PAR:	and that's what some of these guys are . 306475_308215
*PAR:	&-uh and some of these other companies are who were born in Mexico and didn't have that same &-uh &-uh ability to +... 308755_318045
*PAR:	so ‡ <I helped> [//] anytime I could I would try to help them on language or dynamics on what we're working on or how to read prints because prints sometimes they're just [//] &-um they could never look at [//] you've never looked at one . 318825_335843
*PAR:	then it looks like [//] &-um a &-like a pile of chicken scratching because it doesn't make sense until you have a &-like a pattern to look at . 335965_347255
*PAR:	and then that way all of a sudden things will start clicking . 347715_349735
*PAR:	and I've done that for &-uh a_lot_of people over my career is to help other people understand how the &+pre prince [: prints] [* p:w] read . 349875_358702
*PAR:	and &-uh <I have> [//] still have people that I get [//] hear from every once in a while . 359425_363125

*PAR:	that's all they ever got . 378575_379515
